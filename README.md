Project Structure

A. We will try to predict the price of the vehicle according to the following features: model, year of manufacture, gearbox, mileage, engine type (gasoline, hybrid, diesel and other), tax, engine size and fuel consumption by distance. That is, we will try to build the new popular car price list for car lots.

B. We would like to measure the average total error of vehicle prices by models. The goal is to reach an accuracy of up to 1000 [euros].

C. We have the most necessary features, we would be happy to receive the type of vehicle if it is private, a taxi and in addition if it is a hatchback or sedan, etc. Although we do not have these features, our existing features are definitely enough to estimate the prices of the models.

D. The proposed algorithm will be a website designed for car parks in order to estimate the purchase and sale prices of the models in their possession
